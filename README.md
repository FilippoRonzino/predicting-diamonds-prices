# About
In our research we will explore the diamond market, focusing specifically on understanding the relationship between the characteristics of a diamond and its price. With the exception of highly unique diamonds typically sold at auctions with distinctive prices, we expect a robust correlation between diamond features and their prices. Our ultimate goal is to construct a predictive model capable of estimating the price of a diamond based on its char- acteristics, using a multivariate linear regression model. This analysis aims to provide a clear perspective on the relative value of diamonds and could have significant implications for the market, facilitating informed decisions for buyers, sellers, and industry operators.
